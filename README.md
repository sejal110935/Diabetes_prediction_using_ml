# Diabetes_prediction_using_ml
Diabetes is a medical disorder that impacts how well our body uses food as fuel. Most food we eat daily is converted to sugar, commonly known as glucose, and then discharged into the bloodstream. Our pancreas releases insulin when the blood sugar levels rise.

Diabetes can cause blood sugar levels to rise if it is not continuously and carefully managed, which raises the chance of severe side effects like heart attack and stroke. We, therefore, choose to forecast using Python machine learning.
